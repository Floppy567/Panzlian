# 3. Semantic Authority

This section defines how meaning is established, modified, and preserved within Panzlian word groups.

Semantic authority in Panzlian is determined by spatial placement, not by lexical category.
Identity, behavior, and contextual influence are encoded through position and bonding strength.
## 3.1 The Nucleos

The nucleos establishes the identity of a word group.

A valid word group must contain exactly one nucleos.
Removing the nucleos invalidates the group.

A nucleos consists of:
- one root (mandatory)
- up to three defining attributes (optional)

A single attribute cannot constitute a nucleos.
Rootless nucleos may exist only as strongly bound multi-attribute constructs that have stabilized into a new root.

## 3.2 Internal Defining Attributes

Defining attributes are internal components of the nucleos.
They are not orbitals.

These attributes are strongly bonded and collectively determine identity.

Each nucleos has exactly three defining slots, spatially fixed:
- top-right
- top-middle
- top-left

The semantic role of each slot is context-dependent.
Common defaults include meaning, shape, and material, but other attributes may occupy these slots if they are more identity-defining.

Defining attributes are ordered.
Rearranging defining attributes produces a different nucleos and therefore a different word.

If more than three defining traits are required, attributes may merge.
Merged attributes increase internal semantic density without increasing slot count.

## 3.3 Orbitals

Orbitals are non-defining modifiers attached to a nucleos.

Orbitals do not establish identity.
They influence interpretation, context, or transformation.

## 3.4 Orbital Regions

Orbitals occupy the bottom layer of a word group.
They are divided into two functional regions based on position.

### 3.4.1 Bottom-Right Orbitals (Attribute Stack)

Bottom-right orbitals represent non-essential attributes.

They act as a descriptive buffer for properties that are not identity-defining.

- Bottom-right orbitals are read first due to rightmost priority.
- They may stack downward without a fixed limit.
- Removing them does not alter identity.

### 3.4.2 Bottom-Left Orbital (Continuation Slot)

The bottom-left orbital directly influences the nucleos.

This slot typically allows only one orbital.

The continuation orbital may:
- alter the behavior or state of the nucleos
- function as a sub-nucleos
- introduce derivative meaning without a verb

The continuation orbital may have its own orbitals.
Recursive constructions are structurally valid but rare in usage.

## 3.5 Promotion and Authority

Authority in Panzlian is positional.

No word is inherently strong or weak.
Strength is determined solely by placement.

Weak-linked elements may be promoted to defining attributes only during word creation.
Context cannot retroactively redefine identity.

## 3.6 Precedence

When interpreting a word group, precedence is as follows:

1. Root
2. Internal defining attributes (nucleos)
3. Continuation orbital (bottom-left)
4. Attribute stack (bottom-right)

Partial reading preserves identity but may omit behavioral nuance.

## 3.7 Summary

- Identity is established by the nucleos.
- Defining attributes are internal and positional.
- Orbitals modify but do not define.
- Authority is spatial, not lexical.
