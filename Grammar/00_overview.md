# 0. Overview

This document defines the core structural concepts of Panzlian.

Panzlian is not primarily linear. Meaning is distributed across spatially constrained word groups composed of a nucleos (identity core) and orbitals (semantic modifiers).

Reading order is right-to-left, top-to-bottom, unless explicitly overridden by relational bridges.

This specification describes the **formal language**. Colloquial simplifications are defined separately.
